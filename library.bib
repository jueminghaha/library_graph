   abstract = {This is a one-to-one translation of a German-written Ph.D. thesis from 1999.
Quantum designs are sets of orthogonal projection matrices in finite(b)-dimensional Hilbert spaces. A fundamental differentiation is whether all projections have the same rank r, and furthermore the special case r = 1, which contains two important subclasses:

Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) were introduced prior to this thesis and solutions of b + 1 MUBs whenever b is a power of a prime were already given. Unaware of those papers, this concept was generalized here under the notation of regular affine quantum designs. Maximal solutions are given for the general case r ≥ 1, consisting of r(b
2
- 1)/(b - r) so-called complete orthogonal classes whenever b is a power of a prime. For b = 6, an infinite family of MUB triples was constructed and it was — as already done in the author's master's thesis (1991) — conjectured that four MUBs do not exist in this dimension.


Symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC POVMs) in this paper are called regular quantum 2-designs with degree 1. The assigned vectors span b
2
equiangular lines. These objects had been investigated since the 1960s, but only a few solutions were known in complex vector spaces. In this thesis further maximal analytic and numerical solutions were given (today a lot more solutions are known) and it was (probably for the first time) conjectured that solutions exist in any dimension b (generated by the Weyl–Heisenberg group and with a certain additional symmetry of order 3).},

This answers a question of Erd\H\{o\}s. In fact the argument also applies to sequences $f$ taking values in the unit sphere of a real or complex Hilbert space. The argument uses three ingredients. The first is a Fourier-analytic reduction, obtained as part of the Polymath5 project on this problem, which reduces the problem to the case when $f$ is replaced by a (stochastic) completely multiplicative function $\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf g\}$. The second is a logarithmically averaged version of the Elliott conjecture, established recently by the author, which effectively reduces to the case when $\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf g\}$ usually pretends to be a modulated Dirichlet character. The final ingredient is (an extension of) a further argument obtained by the Polymath5 project which shows unbounded discrepancy in this case.},

We show that the set of all $n$-qubit stabilizer states forms a complex projective $3$-design in dimension $2n$. Stabilizer states had previously only been known to constitute $2$-designs. The main technical ingredient is a general recursion formula for the so-called frame potential of stabilizer states. To establish it, we need to compute the number of stabilizer states with pre-described inner product with respect to a reference state. This, in turn, reduces to a counting problem in discrete symplectic vector spaces for which we find a simple formula. We sketch applications in quantum information and signal analysis.},

   abstract = {A unitary t-design is a set of unitaries that is "evenly distributed" in the sense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the average over the entire unitary group. In various fields – e.g. quantum information theory – one frequently encounters constructions that rely on matrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices to sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This results in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent unitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford group. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a 4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which the Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for various applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex signal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true 4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor power of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the 4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer code – a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error correction codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can be decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete symplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective 4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford orbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence suggesting that these orbits actually constitute complex projective 5-designs.},

   abstract = {Although symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC POVMs, or SICs for short) have been constructed in every dimension up to 67, a general existence proof remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to show that the SIC existence problem is equivalent to three other, on the face of it quite different problems. Although it is still not clear whether these reformulations of the problem will make it more tractable, we believe that the fact that SICs have these connections to other areas of mathematics is of some intrinsic interest. Specifically, we reformulate the SIC problem in terms of (1) Lie groups, (2) Lie algebras and (3) Jordan algebras (the second result being a greatly strengthened version of one previously obtained by Appleby, Flammia and Fuchs). The connection between these three reformulations is non-trivial: It is not easy to demonstrate their equivalence directly, without appealing to their common equivalence to SIC existence. In the course of our analysis we obtain a number of other results which may be of some independent interest.},

   abstract = {We investigate self-dual vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and super algebras (SVOAs). Using the genus one correlation functions, it is shown that self-dual SVOAs exist only for half-integral central charges. It is described how self-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central charge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized. One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a self-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second largest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine module has the character q(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q(3/2)+ 96256q2+ 1143745q(5/2) +...) and is the "shorter cousin" of the Moonshine module. Its lattice and code analog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that the shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character. The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are self-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We show that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and that extremal SVOAs exist only for the central charges c=0.5, 1, ..., 7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. Examples for c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the (shorter) Moonshine module. Again, our results are similar to results known for codes and lattices.},

We study a primal-dual interior point method specialized to clustered low-rank semidefinite programs requiring high precision numerics, which arise from certain multivariate polynomial (matrix) programs through sums-of-squares characterizations and sampling. We consider the interplay of sampling and symmetry reduction as well as a greedy method to obtain numerically good bases and sample points. We apply this to the computation of three-point bounds for the kissing number problem, for which we show a significant speedup. This allows for the computation of improved kissing number bounds in dimensions 11 through 23. The approach performs well for problems with bad numerical conditioning, which we show through new computations for the binary sphere packing problem.},

   abstract = {Operator scrambling denotes the evolution of a simple operator into a complicated one (in the Heisenberg picture), which characterizes quantum chaos in many-body systems. More specifically, a simple operator evolves into a linear superposition of many operators, most of which are many-body operators supported on a region of size much larger than $1$. In general, an operator does not have a definite size but is characterized by a probability distribution of size. The operator size is related to out-of-time-order correlation functions, but these are generically difficult to obtain from experimental observables. In this paper we show that the operator size distribution can be measured in quantum quench experiments. In a quantum spin system, we propose to prepare an ensemble of initial states which are direct product states of random pure states of each spin qudit, and measure a simple physical observable (such as a particular component of spin) at later time $t$. The initial state dependence of the expectation value measures a particular component of the operator size distribution. Furthermore, many other features of the operator size distribution can be measured by analyzing the same data, such as the support of the operator in space.},

repulsive points on the two-dimensional sphere, which can realized in various ways (as a random matrix ensemble, a determinantal point process, a Coulomb gas, a Quantum Hall state...). Here we show that the spherical ensemble enjoys remarkable convergence properties from the point of view of numerical integration. More precisely, it is shown that the numerical integration rule corresponding to
N
nodes on the two-dimensional sphere sampled in the spherical ensemble is, with overwhelming probability, nearly a quasi-Monte-Carlo design in the sense of Brauchart-Saff-Sloan-Womersley for any smoothness parameter


$$s\le 2.$$

The key ingredient is a new explicit sub-Gaussian concentration of measure inequality for the spherical ensemble.},

The emphasis is put on potentials defined by geometric characteristics of sets of points, which serve as multi-input generalizations of the well-known Riesz potentials for pairwise interaction. One of such potentials is volume squared of the simplex with vertices at the $k \ge 3$ given points: we show that the arising energy is maximized by balanced isotropic measures, in contrast to the classical two-input energy. These results are used to obtain interesting geometric optimality properties of the regular simplex. As the main machinery, we adapt the semidefinite programming method to this context and establish relevant versions of the $k$-point bounds.},

To encourage robustness, it iteratively computes adversarial examples for the model, and then re-trains on these examples via some update rule. This work analyzes the performance of adversarial training on linearly separable data, and provides bounds on the number of iterations required for large margin. We show that when the update rule is given by an arbitrary empirical risk minimizer, adversarial training may require exponentially many iterations to obtain large margin. However, if gradient or stochastic gradient update rules are used, only polynomially many iterations are required to find a large-margin separator. By contrast, without the use of adversarial examples, gradient methods may require exponentially many iterations to achieve large margin. Our results are derived by showing that adversarial training with gradient updates minimizes a robust version of the empirical risk at a \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{O\}(\ln(t)2/t)$ rate, despite non-smoothness. We corroborate our theory empirically.},

   abstract = {In conventional industrial computed tomography, the source–detector system rotates in equiangular steps in-plane relative to the part of investigation. While being by far the most frequently used acquisition trajectory today, this method has several drawbacks like the formation of cone beam artefacts or limited usability in case of geometrical restrictions. In such cases, the usage of alternative spherical trajectories can be beneficial to improve image quality and defect visibility. While investigations have been performed to relate the influence of the trajectory choice in the typical metrological case of a high number of available projections, so far barely any work has been done for the case of few source–detector poses, which is more relevant in the field of non-destructive testing. In this work, we provide an overview of quantitative metrics that can be used to assess the image quality of reconstructed computed tomography volumes, discuss their advantages and drawbacks and propose a framework to investigate the performance of several non-standard trajectories with respect to previously defined regions of interest. Inspired by pseudorandom sampling methods for Monte–Carlo-algorithms, we also suggest an entirely new trajectory design, the low-discrepancy spherical trajectory, which extends the concept of equiangular planar trajectories into three dimensions and can be used for benchmarking and comparison with other spherical trajectories. Last, we use an optimization method to calculate task-specific acquisition trajectories and relate their performance to other spherical designs.},

As a consequence of the latter, we obtain optimality of the Kerdock binary codes of block length $64$, $256$, and $1024$, as well as uniqueness for block length $64$. We also prove universal optimality for $288$ points on a sphere in $16$ dimensions. To prove these results, we use three-point semidefinite programming bounds, for which only a few sharp cases were known previously. To obtain rigorous results, we develop improved techniques for rounding approximate solutions of semidefinite programs to produce exact optimal solutions.},

   abstract = {Toric $t$-designs, or equivalently $t$-designs on the diagonal subgroup of the unitary group, are sets of points on the torus over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full torus. Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs on the projective torus, which have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various new constructions of toric and projective toric designs and prove bounds on their size. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs. In particular, we construct families of (uniformly-weighted) quantum state $2$-designs in dimension $d$ of size exactly $d(d+1)$ that do not form complete sets of MUBs, thereby disproving a conjecture concerning the relationship between designs and MUBs (Zhu 2015). We then propose a modification of Zhu's conjecture and discuss potential paths towards proving this conjecture. We prove a fundamental distinction between complete sets of MUBs in prime-power dimensions versus in dimension $6$ (and, we conjecture, in all non-prime-power dimensions), the distinction relating to group structure of the corresponding projective toric design. Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number theory, geometry, and quantum information.},

   abstract = {Stokes flows with near-touching rigid particles induce near-singular lubrication forces under relative motion, making their accurate numerical treatment challenging. With the aim of controlling the accuracy with a computationally cheap method, we present a new technique that combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the method of images. For rigid spheres, we propose to represent the flow using Stokeslet proxy sources on interior spheres, augmented by lines of image sources adapted to each near-contact to resolve lubrication. Source strengths are found by a least-squares solve at contact-adapted boundary collocation nodes. We include extensive numerical tests, and validate against reference solutions from a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. With less than 60 image sources per particle per contact, we show controlled uniform accuracy to three relative digits in surface velocities, and up to five digits in particle forces and torques, for all separations down to a thousandth of the radius. In the special case of flows around fixed particles, the proxy sphere alone gives controlled accuracy. A one-body preconditioning strategy allows acceleration with the fast multipole method, hence close to linear scaling in the number of particles. This is demonstrated by solving problems of up to 2000 spheres on a workstation using only 700 proxy sources per particle.},

Spherical designs are finite sets of points on the sphere  with the property that the average of certain (low‐degree) polynomials in these points coincides with the global average of the polynomial on . They are evenly distributed and often exhibit a great degree of regularity and symmetry. We point out that a spectral definition of spherical designs transfers to finite graphs—these ‘graphical designs’ are subsets of vertices that are evenly spaced and capture the symmetries of the underlying graph (should they exist). Our main result states that good graphical designs either consist of many vertices or their neighborhoods have exponential volume growth. We show several examples, describe ways to find them and discuss problems.},

We show that the potentials of most of the known sharp codes attain the universal lower bounds for polarization for spherical \$\{\textbackslash\}tau$-designs previously derived by the authors, where ``universal'' is meant in the sense of applying to a large class of potentials that includes absolutely monotone functions of inner products. We also extend our universal bounds to $T$-designs and the associated polynomial subspaces determined by the vanishing moments of spherical configurations and thus obtain the minima for the icosahedron, dodecahedron, and sharp codes coming from $E_8$ and the Leech lattice. For this purpose, we investigate quadrature formulas for certain subspaces of Gegenbauer polynomials $P\{(n)\}_j$ which we call PULB subspaces, particularly those having basis \$\{\textbackslash\}\{P_j\{(n)\\}\{\textbackslash\}\}_\{j=0\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{2k+2\\}\{\textbackslash\}setminus \\{P_\{2k\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{(n)\\}\{\textbackslash\}\}.$ Furthermore, for potentials with $h\{(\tau+1)\\}\{\textless\}0$ we prove that the strong sharp codes and the antipodal sharp codes attain the universal bounds and their minima occur at points of the codes. The same phenomenon is established for the $600$-cell when the potential $h$ satisfies $h\{(i)\\}\{\textbackslash\}geq 0$, $i=1,\dots,15$, and $h\{(16)\\}\{\textbackslash\}leq 0.$},

Real spherical designs and real and complex projective designs have been shown by Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel to give rise to association schemes when the strength of the design is high compared to its degree as a code. In contrast, designs on the complex unit sphere remain relatively uninvestigated, despite their importance in numerous applications. In this paper, we develop the notion of a complex spherical design and show how many such designs carry the structure of an association scheme. In contrast with the real spherical designs and the real and complex projective designs, these association schemes are nonsymmetric.},

   abstract = {Let $G=(V,E)$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices and let \$\{\textbackslash\}mu_0$ be a probability measure on $V$. The act of moving to a randomly chosen neighbor leads to a sequence of probability measures supported on $V$ given by \$\{\textbackslash\}mu_\{k+1\} = A D\{-1\} \mu_k$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $D$ is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees of $G$. Ordering the eigenvalues of $ A D\{-1\}$ as $1 = \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \dots \geq \lambda_n \geq 0$, it is well-known that the graphs for which \$\{\textbar\}\lambda_2$ is small are those in which the random walk process converges quickly to the uniform distribution: for all initial probability measures \$\{\textbackslash\}mu_0$ and all $k \geq 0$, $$ \sum_\{v \in V\} \left \mu_k(v) - \frac\{1\}\{n\} \right2 \leq \lambda_2\{2k\}.$$ One could wonder whether this rate can be improved for specific initial probability measures \$\{\textbackslash\}mu_0$. We show that if $G$ is regular, then for any $1 \leq \ell \leq n$, there exists a probability measure \$\{\textbackslash\}mu_0$ supported on at most \$\{\textbackslash\}ell$ vertices so that $$ \sum_\{v \in V\} \left \mu_k(v) - \frac\{1\}\{n\} \right2 \leq \lambda_\\{\{\textbackslash\}ell+1\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{2k\}.$$ The result has applications in the graph sampling problem: we show that these measures have good sampling properties for reconstructing global averages.},

   abstract = {A set of lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ passing through the origin is called equiangular if any two lines in the set form the same angle. We proved an alternative version of the three-point semidefinite constraints developed by Bachoc and Vallentin, and the multi-point semidefinite constraints developed by Musin for spherical codes. The alternative semidefinite constraints are simpler when the concerned object is a spherical $s$-distance set. Using the alternative four-point semidefinite constraints, we found the four-point semidefinite bound for equiangular lines. This result improves the upper bounds for infinitely many dimensions $d$ with prescribed angles. As a corollary of the bound, we proved the uniqueness of the maximum construction of equiangular lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ for $7 \leq d \leq 14$ with inner product \$\{\textbackslash\}alpha = 1/3$, and for $23 \leq d \leq 64$ with \$\{\textbackslash\}alpha = 1/5$.},

Learning mappings of data on manifolds is an important topic in contemporary machine learning, with applications in astrophysics, geophysics, statistical physics, medical diagnosis, biochemistry, and 3D object analysis. This paper studies the problem of learning real-valued functions on manifolds through filtered hyperinterpolation of input–output data pairs where the inputs may be sampled deterministically or at random and the outputs may be clean or noisy. Motivated by the problem of handling large data sets, it presents a parallel data processing approach which distributes the data-fitting task among multiple servers and synthesizes the fitted sub-models into a global estimator. We prove quantitative relations between the approximation quality of the learned function over the entire manifold, the type of target function, the number of servers, and the number and type of available samples. We obtain the approximation rates of convergence for distributed and non-distributed approaches. For the non-distributed case, the approximation order is optimal.},

   abstract = {We prove that low-rank matrices can be recovered efficiently from a small number of measurements that are sampled from orbits of a certain matrix group. As a special case, our theory makes statements about the phase retrieval problem. Here, the task is to recover a vector given only the amplitudes of its inner product with a small number of vectors from an orbit. Variants of the group in question have appeared under different names in many areas of mathematics. In coding theory and quantum information, it is the complex Clifford group; in time-frequency analysis the oscillator group; and in mathematical physics the metaplectic group. It affords one particularly small and highly structured orbit that includes and generalizes the discrete Fourier basis: While the Fourier vectors have coefficients of constant modulus and phases that depend linearly on their index, the vectors in said orbit have phases with a quadratic dependence. In quantum information, the orbit is used extensively and is known as the set of stabilizer states. We argue that due to their rich geometric structure and their near-optimal recovery properties, stabilizer states form an ideal model for structured measurements for phase retrieval. Our results hold for $m\geq C \kappa_r r d \log(d)$ measurements, where the oversampling factor k varies between \$\{\textbackslash\}kappa_r=1$ and \$\{\textbackslash\}kappa_r = r2$ depending on the orbit. The reconstruction is stable towards both additive noise and deviations from the assumption of low rank. If the matrices of interest are in addition positive semidefinite, reconstruction may be performed by a simple constrained least squares regression. Our proof methods could be adapted to cover orbits of other groups.},

Determining the maximum number of unit vectors in  with no pairwise inner product exceeding  is a fundamental problem in geometry and coding theory. In 1955, Rankin resolved this problem for all , and in this paper, we show that the maximum is  for all , answering a question of Bukh and Cox. Moreover, the exponent  is best possible. As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the size of a ‐ary code with block length  and distance , which is tight up to the multiplicative factor  for any prime power  and infinitely many . When , this resolves a conjecture of Tietäväinen from 1980 in a strong form and the exponent  is best possible. Finally, using a recently discovered connection to ‐ary codes, we obtain analogous results for set‐coloring Ramsey numbers.},

The interaction between points is described by the kernel $K(\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf x\},\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf y\})=f(\left\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf x\}-\\{\{\textbackslash\}bf y\\}\{\textbackslash\}right2)$, where \$\{\textbackslash\}left\ \!\cdot\ \!\right$ is the Euclidean norm in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb R\{d+1\}$. The potential function $f$ is assumed to have a convex derivative $f\{(2m-2)\}$. Points of minimum do not depend on $f$ and are those and only those which form exactly $m$ distinct dot products with points of \$\{\textbackslash\}omega_N$. The proof of this theorem was presented at a workshop at ESI in January 2022. Using this result, we find sets of universal minima of certain six configurations on higher-dimensional spheres.},

   abstract = {We propose a novel spectral method for the Allen–Cahn equation on spheres that does not necessarily require quadrature exactness assumptions. Instead of certain exactness degrees, we employ a restricted isometry relation based on the Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund system of quadrature rules to quantify the quadrature error of polynomial integrands. The new method imposes only some conditions on the polynomial degree of numerical solutions to derive the maximum principle and energy stability, and thus, differs substantially from existing methods in the literature that often rely on strict conditions on the time stepping size, Lipschitz property of the nonlinear term, or $L\\{\{\textbackslash\}infty\}$ boundedness of numerical solutions. Moreover, the new method is suitable for long-time simulations because the time stepping size is independent of the diffusion coefficient in the equation. Inspired by the effective maximum principle recently proposed by Li (Ann. Appl. Math., 37(2): 131–290, 2021), we develop an almost sharp maximum principle that allows controllable deviation of numerical solutions from the sharp bound. Further, we show that the new method is energy stable and equivalent to the Galerkin method if the quadrature rule exhibits sufficient exactness degrees. In addition, we propose an energy-stable mixed-quadrature scheme which works well even with randomly sampled initial condition data. We validate the theoretical results about the energy stability and the almost sharp maximum principle by numerical experiments on the 2-sphere \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{S\\}\{\textasciicircum\}2$.},

   abstract = {It is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that information is lost as a result of performing measurements. Indeed, with every quantum measurement one can associate a number – its POVM norm constant – that quantifies how much the distinguishability of quantum states degrades in the worst case as a result of the measurement. This raises the obvious question which measurements preserve the most information in these sense of having the largest norm constant. While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the uniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult to implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford group plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its elements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm constants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that should be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the "degree of localization in phase space" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important Clifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result implies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing pure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here to prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This paper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor powers of the Clifford group.},

This approximation scheme of degree $n$ leverages a hard thresholding operator to filter all hyperinterpolation coefficients, which approximate the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function by a quadrature rule with algebraic exactness $2n$. We prove that hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is the unique solution to an \$\{\textbackslash\}ell_0$-regularized weighted discrete least squares approximation problem. Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is not only idempotent and commutative with hyperinterpolation, but also adheres to the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the discrete (semi) inner product. By the estimate of the reciprocal of Christoffel function, we present the upper bound of the uniform norm of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation operator. Additionally, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation possesses denoising and basis selection abilities akin to Lasso hyperinterpolation. To judge the $L_2$ errors of both hard thresholding and Lasso hyperinterpolations, we propose a criterion that integrates the regularization parameter with the product of noise coefficients and the signs of hyperinterpolation coefficients. Numerical examples on the sphere, spherical triangle and the cube demonstrate the denoising ability of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation.},

   abstract = {We study efficient generations of random diagonal-unitary matrices, an ensemble of unitary matrices diagonal in a given basis with randomly distributed phases for their eigenvalues. Despite the simple algebraic structure, they cannot be achieved by quantum circuits composed of a few-qubit diagonal gates. We introduce diagonal-unitaryt-designs and present two quantum circuits that implement diagonal-unitary 2-design with the computational basis in N-qubit systems. One is composed of single-qubit diagonal gates and controlled-phase gates with randomized phases, which achieves an exact diagonal-unitary 2-design after applying the gates on all pairs of qubits. The number of required gates is N(N - 1)/2. If the controlled-Z gates are used instead of the controlled-phase gates, the circuit cannot achieve an exact 2-design, but achieves an ϵ-approximate 2-design by applying gates on randomly selected pairs of qubits. Due to the random choice of pairs, the circuit obtains extra randomness and the required number of gates is at most O(N
2
(N + log 1/∊)). We also provide an application of the circuits, a protocol of generating an exact 2-design of random states by combining the circuits with a simple classical procedure requiring O(N) random classical bits.},

   abstract = {The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is known to be effective for solving 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet boundary value problems in the exterior of a large collection of simple smooth objects. Here we present new scalable MFS formulations for the corresponding elastance and mobility problems. The elastance problem computes the potentials of conductors with given net charges, while the mobility problem – crucial to rheology and complex fluid applications – computes rigid body velocities given net forces and torques on the particles. The key idea is orthogonal projection of the net charge (or forces and torques) in a rectangular variant of a "completion flow". The proposal is compatible with one-body preconditioning, resulting in well-conditioned square linear systems amenable to fast multipole accelerated iterative solution, thus a cost linear in the particle number. For large suspensions with moderate lubrication forces, MFS sources on inner proxy-surfaces give accuracy on par with a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. Our several numerical tests include a suspension of 10000 nearby ellipsoids, using 26 million total preconditioned degrees of freedom, where GMRES converges to five digits of accuracy in under two hours on one workstation.},

This approach gives unified bounds that are valid for a large class of potential functions. Our lower bounds are optimal for absolutely monotone potentials in the sense that for the linear programming technique they cannot be improved by using polynomials of the same or lower degree. When additional information about the structure (upper and lower bounds for the inner products) of the designs is known, improvements on the bounds are obtained. Furthermore, we provide `test functions' for determining when the linear programming lower bounds for energy can be improved utilizing higher degree polynomials. We also provide some asymptotic results for these energy bounds.},

We develop the theory based on the Terwilliger algebra, which is a noncommutative associative semisimple \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{C\}$-algebra associated with each vertex of an association scheme. We compute explicitly the Fisher type lower bounds on the sizes of relative $t$-designs, assuming that certain irreducible modules behave nicely.

A Euclidean
t
-design, as introduced by Neumaier and Seidel (1988), is a finite set 𝒳 ⊂ ℝ

n

with a weight function
w
: 𝒳 → ℝ
+
for which



holds for every polynomial ƒ of total degree at most
t
; here
R
is the set of norms of the points in 𝒳,

W
r

is the total weight of all elements of 𝒳 with norm
r


S
r

is the
n
-dimensional sphere of radius
r
centered at the origin, and



is the average of ƒ over

S
r

. Neumaier and Seidel (1988), as well as Delsarte and Seidel (1989), also proved a Fisher-type inequality 𝒳 ≥
N
(
n

R
,
t
) (assuming that the design is antipodal if
t
is odd). For fixed
n
and 
R
 we have
N
(
n

R
,
t
) =
O
(
t

n
−1

).


This paper contains two main results. First, we provide a recursive construction for Euclidean
t
-designs in ℝ

n

. Namely, we show how to use certain Gauss–Jacobi quadrature formulae to ‘lift’ a Euclidean
t
-design in ℝ

n
−1

to a Euclidean
t
-design in ℝ

n

preserving both the norm spectrum
R
and the weight sum

W
r

for each
r
∈
R
. For fixed
n
and 
R
 this construction yields a design of size
O
(
t

n
−1

); however, the coefficient of
t

n
−1

here is significantly greater than it is in
N
(
n

R
,
t
).


A Euclidean design with exactly
N
(
n

R
,
t
) points is called tight; in both of the above mentioned papers it was conjectured that a tight Euclidean design with
t
≥ 4 must be a spherical design, that is, 
R
 = 1 and
w
is constant on 𝒳. Bannai and Bannai (2003) disproved this conjecture by exhibiting an example for the parameters, (
n

R
,
t
) = (2,2,4). Here we construct tight Euclidean designs for
n
= 2 and every
t
and 
R
 with 
R

   abstract = {This paper provides a semidefinite programming hierarchy based on state polynomial optimization to determine the existence of quantum codes with given parameters. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that if a $(\!(n,K,\delta)\!)_2$ code does not exist then a level of the hierarchy is infeasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus applicable generally. While it is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes through quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of classical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\'asz bound for self-dual quantum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor variation of this Lov\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a symmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite programming bounds of size $O(n4)$. With this we give an alternative proof that there is no $(\!(7,1,4)\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that $(\!(8,9,3)\!)_2$ and $(\!(10,5,4)\!)_2$ codes do not exist.},

An extension of the Delsarte method is presented that relates upper bounds on the size of spherical codes to upper bounds on codes in caps. Several new upper bounds on codes in caps are derived. Applications of these bounds to estimates of the kissing numbers and one-sided kissing numbers are considered. It is proved that the maximum size of codes in spherical caps for large dimensions is determined by the maximum size of spherical codes, so these problems are asymptotically equivalent.},

This definition was introduced by Kharaghani and Suda in 2019, although equivalent formulations have been previously studied using different terminology. We collate previous results phrased in terms of balanced splittable Hadamard matrices, real flat equiangular tight frames, spherical two-distance sets, and two-distance tight frames. We use combinatorial analysis to restrict the parameters of a balanced splittable Hadamard matrix to lie in one of several classes, and obtain strong new constraints on their mutual relationships. An important consideration in determining these classes is whether the strongly regular graph associated with the balanced splittable Hadamard matrix is primitive or imprimitive. We construct new infinite families of balanced splittable Hadamard matrices in both the primitive and imprimitive cases. A rich source of examples is provided by packings of partial difference sets in elementary abelian 2-groups, from which we construct Hadamard matrices admitting a row decomposition so that the balanced splittable property holds simultaneously with respect to every union of the submatrices of the decomposition.},

Instead of grinding to a halt or spurting out noise, this method is still able to decode messages correctly or almost correctly. I have no idea why the method works: this is my first reason for writing this paper using a narrative instead of formal scientific style (the second one is that I am tired of writing semi-formal prose, and long for a change).},

   abstract = {The theory of designs is an important branch of combinatorial mathematics. It is well-known in the theory of designs that a finite subset of a sphere is a tight spherical 1-design if and only if it is a pair of antipodal points. On the other hand, antipodal sets and 2-number for a Riemannian manifold are introduced by B.-Y. Chen and T. Nagano in 1982. An antipodal set is called a great antipodal set if its cardinality is equal to the 2-number. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a survey on important results in compact symmetric spaces with great antipodal sets as the designs. In the last two sections of this paper, we present some important applications of 2-number and great antipodal sets to topology and group theory.},

We also discuss the advantages of the derived theoretical results in a concrete biological application.},

   abstract = {In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum number of equiangular lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}r$ with angle \$\{\textbackslash\}arccos(\alpha)$ and gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha2 - 2$. At the other extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to \$\{\textbackslash\}binom\{r+1\}\{2\}$ equiangular lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}r$. Applications of our method in the complex setting will be discussed as well.},

To this end, we use various methods of harmonic analysis, such as Ces\`aro averages of Jacobi expansions and $A_1$ inequalities, and establish a rather general theorem guaranteeing that certain energies with singular kernels are minimized by \$\{\textbackslash\}sigma$. In addition, we obtain further results and present numerical evidence, which uncover a peculiar effect that minimizers this energy undergo numerous phase transitions, in sharp contrast with many analogous known examples (even the seemingly similar geodesic Riesz energy on the sphere), which usually have only one transition (between uniform and discrete minimizers).},

The universality is in the sense of Cohn-Kumar – every attaining code is optimal with respect to a large class of potential functions (absolutely monotone), in the sense of Levenshtein – there is a bound for every weighted code, and in the sense of parameters (nodes and weights) – they are independent of the potential function. We derive a necessary condition for optimality (in the linear programming framework) of our lower bounds which is also shown to be sufficient when the potential is strictly absolutely monotone. Bounds are also obtained for the weighted energy of weighted spherical designs. We explore our bounds for several previously studied weighted spherical codes.},

We compute the addition law, under system composition, for this quantity and find that, in the case of separable states, it is of simple pythagorean form. In the presence of entanglement, we find that the composite state "rotates faster than its parts", thus unveiling a kinematical origin for the correlation of total variance with entanglement. We analyze a similar definition for the acceleration of a state under rotations, for both pure and mixed states, and probe numerically its relation with a wide array of entanglement related measures.},

   abstract = {Relative $t$-designs in the $n$-dimensional hypercube \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{Q\}_n$ are equivalent to weighted regular $t$-wise balanced designs, which generalize combinatorial $t$-$(n,k,\lambda)$ designs by allowing multiple block sizes as well as weights. Partly motivated by the recent study on tight Euclidean $t$-designs on two concentric spheres, in this paper we discuss tight relative $t$-designs in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{Q\}_n$ supported on two shells. We show under a mild condition that such a relative $t$-design induces the structure of a coherent configuration with two fibers. Moreover, from this structure we deduce that a polynomial from the family of the Hahn hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials must have only integral simple zeros. The Terwilliger algebra is the main tool to establish these results. By explicitly evaluating the behavior of the zeros of the Hahn polynomials when they degenerate to the Hermite polynomials under an appropriate limit process, we prove a theorem which gives a partial evidence that the non-trivial tight relative $t$-designs in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{Q\}_n$ supported on two shells are rare for large $t$.},

We employ quadrature rules that satisfy the Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund property to construct hyperinterpolation for approximating the product of the continuous kernel and the solution, in terms of spherical harmonics. By leveraging this property, we significantly expand the family of candidate quadrature rules and establish a connection between the geometrical information of the quadrature points and the error analysis of the method. We then utilize product integral rules to evaluate the singular integral with the integrand being the product of the singular kernel and each spherical harmonic. We derive a practical $L\\{\{\textbackslash\}infty\}$ error bound, which consists of two terms: one controlled by the best approximation of the product of the continuous kernel and the solution, and the other characterized by the Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund property and the best approximation polynomial of this product. Numerical examples validate our numerical analysis.},

There are many multivariate generalizations of the Remez inequality, but most have constants that depend strongly on dimension. Here we show that a broad class of domains $X$ and test sets $Y$ – termed \emph\{norm designs\} – enjoy dimension-free Remez-type estimates. Instantiations of this theorem allow us for example \emph\{a\}) to bound the supremum of an $n$-variate degree-$d$ polynomial on the solid cube \$[0,1]\{\textasciicircum\}n$ by its supremum on the regular grid \$\{\textbackslash\}\{0,1/d,2/d,\ldots, 1\\\}\{\textasciicircum\}n$ independent of dimension; and \emph\{b\}) in the case of a degree-$d$ polynomial $f:\mathbf\{Z\}_Kn\to\mathbf\{C\}$ on the $n$-fold product of cyclic groups of order $K$, to show the supremum of $f$ does not increase by more than \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{O\}(\log K)\{2d\}$ when $f$ is extended to the polytorus as $f:\mathbf\{T\\}\{\textasciicircum\}n\to\mathbf\{C\}$.},

Ultraspherical/Gegenbauer polynomials are highly valuable when designing axisymmetric beams and understanding spherical t designs, and this report will shed some light on what circular, spherical, and ultraspherical axisymmetric polynomials are. While mathematically interesting by themselves already, they can be useful in spherical beamforming as described in the literature on spherical and differential microphone arrays. In this report, these ultraspherical/Gegenbauer polynomials will be used to uniformly derive for arbitrary dimensions D the various directivity designs or Ambisonic order weightings known from literature: max-DI/basic, max-rE , supercardioid, cardioid/inphase. Is there a way to relate higher-order cardioids and supercardioids? How could one define directivity patterns with an on-axis flatness constraint?},

Godsil (resp., Brouwer) conjectured that the edge connectivity (resp., vertex connectivity) of \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma$ is equal to its valency. In this paper, we prove that the deletion of the neighborhood of any vertex leaves behind at most one non-singleton component. Two vertices $a,b\in X$ are called "twins" in \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma$ if they have identical neighborhoods: \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma(a)=\Gamma(b)$. We characterize twins in polynomial association schemes and show that, in the absence of twins, the deletion of any vertex and its neighbors in \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma$ results in a connected graph. Using this and other tools, we find lower bounds on the connectivity of \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma$, especially in the case where \$\{\textbackslash\}Gamma$ has diameter two. Among the applications of these results, we find that the only connected relations in symmetric association schemes which admit a disconnecting set of size two are those which are ordinary polygons.},

Starting from a semidefinite programming hierarchy for the dominating set problem in graph theory, we derive the new hierarchy for covering and show some of its basic properties: The hierarchy converges in finitely many steps, but the first level collapses to the volume bound when the compact metric space is homogeneous.},

Such nodal systems always exist; their construction has been given in earlier work. Here the main results is that the corresponding interpolatory quadrature for the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree two is equally weighted for arbitrary

When considering the shells of a lattice, this problem shifts to the non-vanishing problem of the Fourier coefficients of elliptic cusp forms.

We show that such lattices exist in arbitrarily large dimensions and demonstrate examples arising from some notable families of graphs. In particular, some well-known root lattices and those related to them can be recovered this way. We discuss various properties of this construction and also mention some potential applications of lattices generated by incoherent systems of vectors.},

   abstract = {The absolute upper bound on the number of equiangular lines that can be found in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ is $d(d+1)/2$. Examples of sets of lines that saturate this bound are only known to exist in dimensions $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. By considering the additional property of incoherence, we prove that there exists a set of equiangular lines that saturates the absolute bound and the incoherence bound if and only if $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. This allows us classify all tight spherical $5$-designs $X$ in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{S\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{d-1\}$, the unit sphere, with the property that there exists a set of $d$ points in $X$ whose pairwise inner products are positive. For a given angle \$\{\textbackslash\}kappa$, there exists a relative upper bound on the number of equiangular lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ with common angle \$\{\textbackslash\}kappa$. We prove that classifying sets of lines that saturate this bound along with the incoherence bound is equivalent to classifying certain quasi-symmetric designs, which are combinatorial designs with two block intersection numbers. Given a further natural assumption, we classify the known sets of lines that saturate these two bounds. This family comprises of the lines mentioned above and the maximal set of $16$ equiangular lines found in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}6$. There are infinitely many known sets of lines that saturate the relative bound, so this result is surprising. To shed some light on this, we identify the $E_8$ lattice with the projection onto an $8$-dimensional subspace of a sublattice of the Leech lattice defined by $276$ equiangular lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{23\}$. This identification leads us to observe a correspondence between sets of equiangular lines in small dimensions and the exceptional curves of del Pezzo surfaces.},

   abstract = {We present an \$\{\textbackslash\}ell2_2+\ell_1$-regularized discrete least squares approximation over general regions under assumptions of hyperinterpolation, named hybrid hyperinterpolation. Hybrid hyperinterpolation, using a soft thresholding operator and a filter function to shrink the Fourier coefficients approximated by a high-order quadrature rule of a given continuous function with respect to some orthonormal basis, is a combination of Lasso and filtered hyperinterpolations. Hybrid hyperinterpolation inherits features of them to deal with noisy data once the regularization parameter and the filter function are chosen well. We derive $L_2$ errors in theoretical analysis for hybrid hyperinterpolation to approximate continuous functions with noise data on sampling points. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results and show that well chosen regularization parameters can enhance the approximation quality over the unit-sphere and the union of disks.},

   abstract = {I. J. Schoenberg proved that a function is positive definite in the unit sphere if and only if this function is a nonnegative linear combination of Gegenbauer polynomials. This fact play a crucial role in Delsarte's method for finding bounds for the density of sphere packings on spheres and Euclidean spaces. One of the most excited applications of Delsarte's method is a solution of the kissing number problem in dimensions 8 and 24. However, 8 and 24 are the only dimensions in which this method gives a precise result. For other dimensions (for instance, three and four) the upper bounds exceed the lower. We have found an extension of the Delsarte method that allows to solve the kissing number problem (as well as the one-sided kissing number problem) in dimensions three and four. In this paper we also will discuss the maximal cardinalities of spherical two-distance sets. Using the so-called polynomial method and Delsarte's method these cardinalities can be determined for all dimensions $n40$. Recently, were found extensions of Schoenberg's theorem for multivariate positive-definite functions. Using these extensions and semidefinite programming can be improved some upper bounds for spherical codes.},

   abstract = {One may think of a $d$-class association scheme as a $(d+1)$-dimensional matrix algebra over \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\}$ closed under Schur products. In this context, an imprimitive scheme is one which admits a subalgebra of block matrices, also closed under the Schur product. Such systems of imprimitivity provide us with quotient schemes, smaller association schemes which are often easier to understand, providing useful information about the structure of the larger scheme. For any association scheme we find a basis of $d+1$ idempotent matrices for the algebra. A cometric scheme is one whose idempotent basis may be ordered $E_0,E_1,...,E_d$ with polynomials $f_0,f_1,...,f_d$ giving $f_i\circ(E_1)=E_i$ and deg$(f_i)=i$ for each $i$. Throughout this thesis we are primarily interested in three goals: building new examples of cometric schemes, drawing connections between cometric schemes and other objects, and finding new realizability conditions on feasible parameter sets — using these conditions to rule out open parameter sets when possible. After introducing association schemes, this thesis focuses on a few recent results regarding cometric schemes with small $d$. We begin by examining the matrix algebra, looking for low rank positive semidefinite matrices with few distinct entries and later establishing new conditions on realizable parameter sets. We then focus on imprimitive examples of both 3- and 4-class cometric schemes, generating new examples of the former while building realizability conditions for both. In each case, we examine the related $t$-distance sets, giving conditions which work towards equivalence; in the case of 3-class $Q$-antipodal schemes an equivalence is established. We conclude by partially extending a result of Brouwer and Koolen concerning the connectivity of graphs arising from metric schemes.},

   abstract = {We develop a novel stepsize based on \BB method for solving some challenging optimization problems efficiently, named regularized \BB (RBB) stepsize. We indicate that RBB stepsize is the close solution to a \$\{\textbackslash\}ell_\{2\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{2\}$-regularized least squares problem. When the regularized item vanishes, the RBB stepsize reduces to the original \BB stepsize. RBB stepsize includes a class of valid stepsizes, such as another version of \BB stepsize. The global convergence of the corresponding RBB algorithm is proved in solving convex quadratic optimization problems. One scheme for adaptively generating regularization parameters was proposed, named adaptive two-step parameter. An enhanced RBB stepsize is used for solving quadratic and general optimization problems more efficiently. RBB stepsize could overcome the instability of BB stepsize in many ill-conditioned optimization problems. Moreover, RBB stepsize is more robust than BB stepsize in numerical experiments. Numerical examples show the advantage of using the proposed stepsize to solve some challenging optimization problems vividly.},

We obtain two generalizations of this theorem for p.d. kernels on fiber bundles. Our first theorem characterizes invariant p.d. kernels on bundles whose fiber is a product of a compact set and the unit sphere. This result implies, in particular, a characterization of invariant under the automorphisms of the sphere, p.d. kernels on a product of $S\{n-1\}$ and a compact set. Our second result characterizes invariant p.d. kernels on the bundle whose fiber is $S\{n-1\}$, base space is $(S\{n-1\})\{r\}$ and map is the projection on the base space. This set of kernels is isomorphic to the set of invariant under the automorphisms of the sphere continuous functions $F$ on $(S\{n-1\})\{r+2\}$ such that $F(\cdot,\cdot ,Z)$ is positive definite for every $Z \in (S\{n-1\})\{r\}$. When $Z$ is fixed, this class reduces to the class of p.d. kernels invariant under the stabilizer of $Z$ in the automorphism group of the sphere. For $r=1$ these kernels have been used to obtain upper bounds for the spherical codes problem. Our extension for $r1$ can be used to construct new upper bounds on the size of spherical codes.},

We investigate two kinds of spherical $t$-designs with $t$ up to 160. One is well conditioned spherical $t$-design(WSTD), which was proposed by [1] with $ N=(t+1)\{2\} $. The other is efficient spherical $t$-design(ESTD), given by Womersley [2], which is made of roughly of half cardinality of WSTD. Consequently, a series of persuasive numerical evidences indicates that WSTD is better than ESTD in the sense of worst-case error in Sobolev space $ \mathbb\{H\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{s\}(\mathbb\{S\\}\{\textasciicircum\}2) $. Furthermore, WSTD is employed to approximate integrals of various of functions, especially including integrand has a point singularity over the unit sphere and a given ellipsoid. In particular, to deal with singularity of integrand, Atkinson's transformation [3] and Sidi's transformation [4] are implemented with the choices of `grading parameters' to obtain new integrand which is much smoother. Finally, the paper presents numerical results on uniform errors for approximating representive integrals over sphere with three quadrature rules: Bivariate trapezoidal rule, Equal area points and WSTD.},

We investigate the extremal constant C(X,Y) defined to be the supremum of integrals of functions f from the class F(X,Y), where F(X,Y) is the family of positive definite functions f on G such that f(0) = 1, the positive part of f is supported in X, and its negative part is supported in Y. In the case when X=Y, the problem is exactly the so-called Tur\'an problem for the set X. When Y= G, i.e., there is a restriction only on the set of positivity of f, we obtain the Delsarte problem. The Delsarte problem is the sharpest Fourier analytic tool to study packing density by translates of a given "master copy" set, which was studied first in connection with packing densities of Euclidean balls. We give an upper estimate of the constant C(X,Y) in the situation when the set X satisfies a certain packing type condition. This estimate is given in terms of the asymptotic uniform upper density of sets in locally compact Abelian groups.},

Coherent configurations are a generalization of association schemes. Motivated by the recent study of
Q
‐polynomial coherent configurations, in this paper, we study the spherical embedding of a
Q
‐polynomial coherent configuration into some eigenspace by a primitive idempotent. We present a necessary and sufficient condition when the embedding becomes a Euclidean ‐design (on two concentric spheres) in terms of the Krein numbers for . In addition, we obtain some Euclidean 2‐ or 3‐designs from spherical embedding of coherent configurations including tight relative 4‐ or 5‐designs in binary Hamming schemes and the union of derived designs of a tight 4‐design in Hamming schemes.},

   abstract = {Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$. If any squared distance of two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$. Rosenfeld (1997) proved that there exists $(d+2)$-point $X$ in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the field \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{Z\}/2\mathbb\{Z\}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\},\mathfrak\{p\}A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\}$. Let $A=\mathcal\{O\}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and \$\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}$ a prime ideal of \$\{\textbackslash\}mathcal\{O\}_K$. Let $(A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\},\mathfrak\{p\}A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\setminus \mathfrak\{p\})\{-1\} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\}$. If the squared distances of $X\subset \mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ are in $A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \not\equiv 0 $ modulo \$\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\} A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}$, then \$\{\textbar\}X \leq d+2$. In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\subset \mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ attaining the upper bound \$\{\textbar\}X \leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the field $A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}/ \mathfrak\{p\} A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}/ \mathfrak\{p\} A\_\{\textbackslash\}mathfrak\{p\}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also construct examples attaining this upper bound.},

Such vector sets generalize the notion of a maximal collection of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). MUBs have manifold applications in quantum information theory (e.g. in state tomography, cloning, or cryptography) – however it is suspected that maximal sets exist only in prime-power dimensions. Our construction offers an efficient alternative for general dimensions. The findings are based on a framework recently established in [A. Roy and A. Scott, J. Math.

More precisely, it is shown that the numerical integration rule corresponding to N nodes on the two-dimensional sphere sampled in the spherical ensemble is, with overwhelming probability, nearly a quasi-Monte-Carlo design in the sense of Brauchart-Saff-Sloan-Womersley (for any smoothness parameter s less than or equal to two).

   abstract = {We show that if a closed discrete subset $A \subseteq \mathbf\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ is denser than a certain critical threshold, then $A$ is a Fourier uniqueness set, while if $A$ is sparser, then uniqueness fails and one can prescribe arbitrary values for a Schwartz function and its Fourier transform on $A$ (assuming those values are rapidly decreasing). More general results of the same nature hold for Fourier uniqueness pairs. This is an analog in all dimensions of the work of Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin in dimension $1$. Our methods are unrelated. As an application of our results, we produce Fourier uniqueness sets in higher dimensions which are optimally well-separated (up to constants). Our techniques also give the first purely analytic construction of discrete Fourier uniqueness pairs in higher dimensions. For a concrete example, consider \begin\{align*\} A = \\\{\{\textbackslash\}delta n\{t-1\} n : n \in \mathbf\{Z\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d\\} \qquad \text\{and\} \qquad B = \\\{\{\textbackslash\}delta n\{u-1\} n : n \in \mathbf\{Z\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d\\}, \end\{align*\} where $t,u,\delta  0$ and $t+u = 1$. We show that when \$\{\textbackslash\}delta$ is sufficiently small, $(A,B)$ is a Fourier uniqueness pair, but when \$\{\textbackslash\}delta$ is sufficiently large, there is an infinite-dimensional space of Schwartz functions $f$ with $f_A = \hat\{f\\}\{\textbar\}_B = 0$.},

Optimizing over this infinite dimensional cone is not tractable, and approximations of this cone have been hardly considered in literature. We propose two convergent hierarchies of subsets of copositive kernels, in terms of non-negative and positive definite kernels. We use these hierarchies and representation theorems for invariant positive definite kernels on the sphere to construct new SDP-based bounds on the kissing number. This results in fast-to-compute upper bounds on the kissing number that lie between the currently existing LP and SDP bounds.},

   abstract = {Compressed sensing is the art of reconstructing structured $n$-dimensional vectors from substantially fewer measurements than naively anticipated. A plethora of analytic reconstruction guarantees support this credo. The strongest among them are based on deep results from large-dimensional probability theory that require a considerable amount of randomness in the measurement design. Here, we demonstrate that derandomization techniques allow for considerably reducing the amount of randomness that is required for such proof strategies. More, precisely we establish uniform s-sparse reconstruction guarantees for $C s \log (n)$ measurements that are chosen independently from strength-four orthogonal arrays and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, respectively. These are highly structured families of \$\{\textbackslash\}tilde\{C\} n2$ vectors that imitate signed Bernoulli and standard Gaussian vectors in a (partially) derandomized fashion.},

The kinematical structure and the dynamical structure of finite dimensional quantum theory are, in light of the Choi-Jamio\\{\{\textbackslash\}l\}kowski isomorphism, one and the same — namely the homogeneous self-dual cones of positive semi-definite linear endomorphisms on finite dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. From the perspective of category theory, these cones are the sets of morphisms in finite dimensional quantum theory as a dagger compact closed category. Understanding the intricate geometry of these cones and charting the wider landscape for their host category is imperative for foundational physics. In Part I of this thesis, we study the shape of finite dimensional quantum theory in terms of quantum information. In Part II of this thesis, we move beyond quantum theory within the vein of Euclidean Jordan algebras. In posting this thesis on the arXiv, we hope that it might serve as a useful resource for those interested in its subjects.},

A finite set on Euclidean space is called a Euclidean a-code if any distinct two points in the set are separated at least by a. As a corollary of the linear programming bound, we give a method to determine an upper bound on the cardinalities of Euclidean a-codes on concentric spheres of given radii.

   abstract = {A spherical $L$-code, where $L \subseteq [-1,\infty)$, consists of unit vectors in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ whose pairwise inner products are contained in $L$. Determining the maximum cardinality $N_L(d)$ of an $L$-code in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ is a fundamental question in discrete geometry and has been extensively investigated for various choices of $L$. Our understanding in high dimensions is generally quite poor. Equiangular lines, corresponding to $L = \\{-\alpha, \alpha\\}$, is a rare and notable solved case. Bukh studied an extension of equiangular lines and showed that $N_L(d) = O_L(d)$ for $L = [-1, -\beta] \cup \\\{\{\textbackslash\}alpha\\}$ with \$\{\textbackslash\}alpha,\beta  0$ (we call such $L$-codes "uniacute"), leaving open the question of determining the leading constant factor. Balla, Dr\"\{a\}xler, Keevash, and Sudakov proved a "uniform bound" showing \$\{\textbackslash\}limsup_\{d\to\infty\} N_L(d)/d \le 2p$ for $L = [-1, -\beta] \cup \\\{\{\textbackslash\}alpha\\}$ and $p = \lfloor \alpha/\beta \rfloor + 1$. For which $(\alpha,\beta)$ is this uniform bound tight? We completely answer this question. We develop a framework for studying uniacute codes, including a global structure theorem showing that the Gram matrix has an approximate $p$-block structure. We also formulate a notion of "modular codes," which we conjecture to be optimal in high dimensions.},

As an application, they gave a simple proof of the Bannai-Bannai-Stanton bound on the size of $s$-distance sets (subsets \$\{\textbackslash\}mbox\{\$\{\textbackslash\}cal A$\\}\{\textbackslash\}subseteq \\{\{\textbackslash\}mathbb R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}n$ which determine at most $s$ different distances). In this paper we extend their work and prove upper bounds for the size of $s$-distance sets in various real algebraic sets. This way we obtain a novel and short proof for the bound of Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel on spherical $s$-distance sets and a generalization of a bound by Bannai-Kawasaki-Nitamizu-Sato on $s$-distance sets on unions of spheres. In our arguments we use the method of Petrov and Pohoata together with some Gr\"obner basis techniques.},

   abstract = {Given a finite subset of a sphere or projective space, known as a design, we can compute the strength and angle set of that design. When the strength and angle set meet certain bounds, the design is called tight. Hoggar sought to prove that, aside from certain known cases, the angle sets of tight projective designs must be rational. Lyubich found a counter-example and provided a repair for Hoggar's proof but excluded the exceptional octonion projective cases. This note extends Lyubich's repair of Hoggar's proof to the remaining projective cases and extends the proof to all spherical cases. It does so by using Jordan algebra primitive idempotents to treat all of the cases simultaneously. We thereby confirm that tight spherical and projective designs have rational angle sets except in specific cases.},

   abstract = {Inspired by compressive sensing principles, we propose novel error control coding techniques for communication systems. The information bits are encoded in the support and the non-zero entries of a sparse signal. By selecting a dictionary matrix with suitable dimensions, the codeword for transmission is obtained by multiplying the dictionary matrix with the sparse signal. Specifically, the codewords are obtained from the sparse linear combinations of the columns of the dictionary matrix. At the decoder, we employ variations of greedy sparse signal recovery algorithms. Using Gold code sequences and mutually unbiased bases from quantum information theory as dictionary matrices, we study the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed scheme in the AWGN channel. Our results show that the proposed scheme has a comparable and competitive performance with respect to the several widely used linear codes, for very small to moderate block lengths. In addition, our coding scheme extends straightforwardly to multi-user scenarios such as multiple access channel, broadcast channel, and interference channel. In these multi-user channels, if the users are grouped such that they have similar channel gains and noise levels, the overall BLER performance of our proposed scheme will coincide with an equivalent single-user scenario.},

   abstract = {In lattice Quantum Field Theory, we are often presented with integrals over polynomials of coefficients of matrices in U(N) or SU(N) with respect to the Haar measure. In some physical situations, e.g., in presence of a chemical potential, these integrals are numerically very difficult since their integrands are highly oscillatory which manifests itself in form of the sign problem. In these cases, Monte Carlo methods often fail to be adequate, rendering such computations practically impossible. We propose a new class of integration rules on U(N) and SU(N) which are derived from polynomially exact rules on spheres. We will examine these quadrature rules and their efficiency at the example of a 0+1 dimensional QCD for a non-zero quark mass and chemical potential. In particular, we will demonstrate the failure of Monte Carlo methods in such applications and that we can obtain polynomially exact, arbitrary precision results using the new integration rules.},

   abstract = {A finite subset $Y$ on the unit sphere $S\{n-1\} \subseteq \mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}n$ is called a spherical design of harmonic index $t$, if the following condition is satisfied: \$\{\textbackslash\}sum_\\{\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{x\\}\{\textbackslash\}in Y\}f(\mathbf\{x\})=0$ for all real homogeneous harmonic polynomials $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of degree $t$. Also, for a subset $T$ of \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{N\} = \\{1,2,\cdots \\}$, a finite subset $Y\subset S\{n-1\}$ is called a spherical design of harmonic index $T,$ if \$\{\textbackslash\}sum_\\{\{\textbackslash\}mathbf\{x\\}\{\textbackslash\}in Y\}f(\mathbf\{x\})=0$ is satisfied for all real homogeneous harmonic polynomials $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of degree $k$ with $k\in T$. In the present paper we first study Fisher type lower bounds for the sizes of spherical designs of harmonic index $t$ (or for harmonic index $T$). We also study 'tight' spherical designs of harmonic index $t$ or index $T$. Here 'tight' means that the size of $Y$ attains the lower bound for this Fisher type inequality. The classification problem of tight spherical designs of harmonic index $t$ was started by Bannai-Okuda-Tagami (2015), and the case $t = 4$ was completed by Okuda-Yu (2015+). In this paper we show the classification (non-existence) of tight spherical designs of harmonic index 6 and 8, as well as the asymptotic non-existence of tight spherical designs of harmonic index $2e$ for general $e\geq 3$. We also study the existence problem for tight spherical designs of harmonic index $T$ for some $T$, in particular, including index $T = \\{8,4\\}$. We use (i) the linear programming method by Delsarte, (ii) the detailed information on the locations of the zeros as well as the local minimum values of Gegenbauer polynomials, (iii) the generalization by Hiroshi Nozaki of the Larman-Rogers-Seidel theorem on $2$-distance sets to $s$-distance sets, (iv) the theory of elliptic diophantine equations, and (v) the semidefinite programming method of eliminating some $2$-angular line systems for small dimensions.},

(2007)] described that one can construct a family of designs on $S\{2n-1\}$ from a design on \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{CP\\}\{\textasciicircum\}\{n-1\}$. In this paper, we prove their claim for the case where $n=2$. That is, we give an algorithm to construct $2t$-designs on $S\{3\}$ as products through a Hopf map $S3 \rightarrow S2$ of a $t$-design on $S2$ and a $2t$-design on $S1$.},

Non-quivalence among absolutely nonsingular tensors with respect to a class of linear transformations, which do not chage the tensor rank,is studied. It is shown theoretically that affine geometric invariants of the constant surface of a determinant polynomial is useful to discriminate non-equivalence among absolutely nonsingular tensors. Also numerical caluculations are presented and these invariants are shown to be useful indeed. For the caluculation of invarinats by 20-spherical design is also commented. We showed that an algebraic problem in tensor data analysis can be attacked by an affine geometric method.},

We consider in more detail a restricted class of these graphs, specifically those with no triangles. In this special case, there are infinitely many feasible sets of parameters for SRGs. Despite this fact there are only seven known examples of such graphs. we develop an algorithm which produces linear equations describing various relations between numbers of induced subgraphs of orders $o$ and $o-1$ in a SRG. We apply our results also on $srg(3250,57,0,1)$ (existence of which is a famous open problem). In this case, the number of induced subgraphs isomorphic to a given graph on $10$ vertices depends only on the number of induced Petersen graphs. Furthermore, we provide new insights about automorphisms of $srg(3250,57,0,1)$ as well as bounds for the numbers of induced $K_\{3,3\}$ in general triangle-free SRGs. At the end of the thesis we discuss possible extension of our approach for the study of so called $t$-vertex condition.},

For many extremal configurations of points on a sphere, the linear programming approach can be used to show their optimality. In this paper we establish the general framework for showing stability of such configurations and use this framework to prove the stability of the two spherical codes formed by minimal vectors of the lattice

Spherical codes have been extensively studied since their introduction in the 1970's by Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel. In this note we prove a conjecture of Bukh on the maximum size of spherical codes. In particular, we show that for any set of $k$ fixed angles, one can choose at most $O(dk)$ lines in \$\{\textbackslash\}mathbb\{R\\}\{\textasciicircum\}d$ such that any pair of them forms one of these angles.},

This caracterization has been extended in various cases, such that family of lattices, sections of lattices, Humbert forms, etc. Moreover, there is a criterion for extreme lattices, discovered by Venkov, formulated in terms of spherical designs which has been extended in the case of Grassmannians and sections of lattices. In this article, we define a general frame, in which there is a ``Voronoi characterization'', and a ``Venkov criterion'' through an appropriate notion of design. This frame encompasses many interesting situations in which a ``Voronoi characterization'' has been proved. We also discuss the question of extremality relatively to the Epstein zeta function, and we extend to our frame a characterization of final zeta-extremality formulated by Delone and Ryshkov and a criterion in terms of designs found by Coulangeon.},

   abstract = {Abstract
Distributing points on a (possibly high‐dimensional) sphere with minimal energy is a long‐standing problem in and outside the field of mathematics. This paper considers a novel energy function that arises naturally from statistics and combinatorial optimization, and studies its theoretical properties. Our result solves both the exact optimal spherical point configurations in certain cases and the minimal energy asymptotics under general assumptions. Connections between our results and the L1‐principal component analysis and quasi‐Monte Carlo methods are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Learning mappings of data on manifolds is an important topic in contemporary machine learning, with applications in astrophysics, geophysics, statistical physics, medical diagnosis, biochemistry, 3D object analysis. This paper studies the problem of learning real-valued functions on manifolds through filtered hyperinterpolation of input-output data pairs where the inputs may be sampled deterministically or at random and the outputs may be clean or noisy. Motivated by the problem of handling large data sets, it presents a parallel data processing approach which distributes the data-fitting task among multiple servers and synthesizes the fitted sub-models into a global estimator. We prove quantitative relations between the approximation quality of the learned function over the entire manifold, the type of target function, the number of servers, and the number and type of available samples. We obtain the approximation rates of convergence for distributed and non-distributed approaches. For the non-distributed case, the approximation order is optimal.},

In this paper, we consider to estimate the maximum size of such antipodal set for small $s$. First, we improve the known bound on \$\{\textbar\}X$ for each even integer $s\in[\frac\{t+5\}\{2\}, t+1]$ when $t\geq 3$. We next focus on two special cases: $s=3,\ t=3$ and $s=4,\ t=5$. Estimating the size of $X$ for these two cases is equivalent to estimating the size of real equiangular tight frames (ETFs) and Levenstein-equality packings, respectively. We first improve the previous estimate on the size of real ETFs and Levenstein-equality packings. This in turn gives a bound on \$\{\textbar\}X$ when $s=3,\ t=3$ and $s=4,\ t=5$, respectively.},

However, it is difficult to construct such optimal codebooks. There have been a number of attempts to construct codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound. In this paper, we introduce a generic construction of codebooks using generalized bent functions from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is a prime and [Formula: see text] is a positive integer with [Formula: see text]. With this construction, we obtain two new families of codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound. These codebooks have new parameters and could have a small alphabet size. In particular, a class of regular generalized bent functions from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] is presented.},

Suppose $v=2(k-\theta_1)$ where \$\{\textbackslash\}theta_1$ is the nontrivial positive eigenvalue of the $(0,1)$ adjacency matrix of $G$. This strongly regular graph is associated with a regular two-graph. Then, $S(G,H)$ is a strongly regular graph with the same parameters if and only if the subgraph induced by $H$ is $k-\frac\{v-h\}\{2\}$ regular. Moreover, $S(G,H)$ is a strognly regualr graph with the other parameters if and only if the subgraph induced by $H$ is $k-\mu$ regular and the size of $H$ is $v/2$. We prove these theorems with the view point of the geometrical theory of the finite set on the Euclidean unit sphere.},
